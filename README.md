# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is an app that will ask you a series of questions and then match you with the person in our database whose values most closely match your own. To begin, click the button that says "Go to Survey". You will be taken to a page with 10 questions with response options randing from 1 - strongly disagree - to 5 - strongly agree. 

Once you have answered all ten questions and filled in the required name and image link fields, hit the submit button. Our API will compare your answers to the users in our API and return the user with the lease overall numerical difference in their answers. A modal will pop up with the matched friend's name and image. 

At any time you can use the links along the bottom of the page - "API Friends List", "Home" and "Github Repo" - to view a raw list of the database, go back to the home page or visit the Github repo for this project in that order. API Friends List displays the potential friends in JSON format.
